<h3> Rashomon </h3>
<p> The forest is the perfect setting for this suspenseful mystery to unfold. I find it thrilling and thought-provoking to watch the order of events from so many perspectives. </p>

<h3> In the Mood for Love </h3>
<p> Breathtaking cinematography, moving music, masterful acting and mise-en-scene. The melancholic romance is conveyed clearly. </p>

<h3> Ali: Fear Eats the Soul </h3>
<p> I love the intentional framing and how it contributes to evoking the deeper message: the suffocating sense of confinement in daily life faced by migrant worker Ali and ex-Nazi Emmi.</p>
